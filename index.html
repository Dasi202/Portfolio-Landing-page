              <h3>About me:</h3>
          </div>
          <p><em>Danlon Situma</em> is a coding student at Moringa School in Nairobi,Kenya.My personal philosophy when it comes to education is closely related to several cognitive theories of motivation.I believe that what goes on the classroom is my responsibility,and,by working with students,all of us can create an ideal environment for education,safety,understanding and even fun.I recently graduated from highschool and with the knowledge I'll acquire from Moringa,I believe I will be a good programmer.

          <div class="test-box">
              <p>Currently,life for humans is way much easier thanks to technology.Many things are computerized and thanks to programming,many tasks are accomplished within a short span of time.It's quite certain that soon enough almost everthing will be running with the help of technology.This is one of the many reasons I decided to take classes on programming. </p>
